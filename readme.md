# Janak Patel Individual Project

Java-based web applicasion for hotel booking website.

# Problem Statement

I want to create a website that anybody can use it with little modification for reservation systems for example to book a wedding hall, photographer, book room.

I'm focusing on creating a website for the independent hotel, I see many companies that does this but they charge lots of money for this so I want to create a website that they can use for free. A hotel system manages information about rooms, reservations, customers, and customer billing. A customer can make reservations, change, or cancel reservations through the hotel website. When a customer makes reservations, he/she needs to check if a room the customer wants to reserve is available. If a room is available, the customer enters his/her information to the system and receives a confirmation number from the web site. I imagine as a developer for one particular hotel that I'm making a website and reservation system for.
