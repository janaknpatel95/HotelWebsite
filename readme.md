# Janak Patel Individual Project

This Is Java-based web applicasion for Hotel booking website.

# Problem Statement

I want to create a website that anybody can use it with little modification for reservation systems for example to book a wedding hall, photographer, book room.

I Am focusing on creating a website for the hotel, I see many websites that does this but they charge lots of money for this so I want to create a website that they can use for free.
A hotel system manages information about rooms, reservations, customers, and customer billing. A customer can make reservations, change, or cancel reservations through the hotel website. When a customer makes reservations, he/she needs to check if a room the customer want to reserve is available. If a room is available, the customer enters his/her information to the system and receives a confirmation number from the web site.
i'm imagine as im devloper for one perticular hotel that i'm making website adn reservasion system for.
